The Undefined Data Type
The undefined data type can only have one value-the special value undefined. If a variable
has been declared, but has not been assigned a value, has the value undefined.

Syntax:
var a;
var b = "Hello World!"
 
alert(a) // Output: undefined
alert(b) // Output: Hello World!
