Formatting Numbers to Fixed Decimals:

You can use the toFixed() method when you want to format a number with a fixed number of 
digits to the right of the decimal point. The value returned by this method is a string 
and it has exactly specified number of digits after the decimal point. If the digits 
parameter is not specified or omitted, it is treated as 0.
