The Null Data Type
This is another special data type that can have only one value-the null value. A null value means that 
there is no value. It is not equivalent to an empty string ("") or 0, it is simply nothing.

A variable can be explicitly emptied of its current contents by assigning it the null value.

var a = null;
alert(a); // Output: null
 
var b = "Hello World!"
alert(b); // Output: Hello World!
 
b = null;
alert(b) // Output: null
