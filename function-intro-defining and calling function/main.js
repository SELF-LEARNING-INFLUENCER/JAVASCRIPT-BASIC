// Defining function
function greeting(){
   document.write("hey,what's up every body" + "<br>");
}
// Calling function
greeting();
greeting();
/*Once a function is defined it can be called (invoked) from anywhere in the document,
 by typing its name followed by a set of parentheses, like greeting() in the example 
 above*/
