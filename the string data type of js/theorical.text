The String Data Type
The string data type is used to represent textual data (i.e. sequences of characters). Strings are created using single or double quotes surrounding one or more characters

Syntax:
var a = 'Hi there!';  // using single quotes
var b = "Hi there!";  // using double quotes
You can include quotes inside the string as long as they don't match the enclosing quotes.
