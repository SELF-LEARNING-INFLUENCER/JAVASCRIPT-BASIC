Formatting Numbers with Precision:

If you want most appropriate form of a number, you can use the toPrecision() method 
instead. This method returns a string representing the number to the specified precision.

If precision is large enough to include all the digits of the integer part of number, 
then the number is formatted using fixed-point notation. Otherwise, the number is 
formatted using exponential notation. The precision parameter is optional.
