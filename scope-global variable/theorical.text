Scope of Variables:
Scope refers to the availability of variables and functions in certain parts of the code.
The scope of the variables defines where the variable can be used in the program(i.e its 
visibility) .

In JavaScript, a variable has two types of scope:

Global Scope
Local Scope

Global Scope:
A variable declared at the top of a program or outside of a function is considered a 
global scope variable and they can be used and manipulated any where in the program.
